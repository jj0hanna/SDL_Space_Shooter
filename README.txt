To play this game:

Start the executable, wait for the enemies to spawn. You get points for every enemy you kill.
If you die then your score will be reset.
Use WASD for movment and shoot with the mouse.

To make this project in a data oriented way i decided to create objectpoolings and to split the enemy and the
player script in stucts "Movment" and "Body". In this way i could start the game with creating
the bullets and the enemies and easy use them when needed. And i could manipulate ether
only the body or the movment of the player or an enemy.
